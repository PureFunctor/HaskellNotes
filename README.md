# HaskellNotes
My personal notes for Haskell's language features and concepts.

The repository layout and files should be fairly similar to that of my [purescript-notes](https://github.com/PureFunctor/purescript-notes). Language features will differ, of course, and so will be the techniques used to demonstrate them.

## Building
This project uses the following tools:
* `GHC 8.8.4`
* `stack`
* `hpack`

You can play around the different source files by invoking a REPL and importing them:
```bash
$ stack repl
```
